# Girakkacyclops

## A fork of the awesome *[Cyclops](https://github.com/aol/cyclops)* project

## Project Objectives:
- Make it easier to distinguish among the multitude of functional data structures, constructs, and tools the Cyclops project 
  provides by:
  - Changing packages and package names to clarify how the classes fit together and what their use cases might be
  - Renaming classes and interfaces where there might be some confusion 
  - Adding documentation to the code where it might be helpful
  - Reformatting the original code
- Provide new constructs using Cyclops components
- Create fluent interfaces building on the Cyclops project to keep it current
- Upgrade the Cyclops project Gradle build configuration
- Keep Java _func-y_
